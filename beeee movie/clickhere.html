  <h1>  beeee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript </h1>
<p>A Corah Production<p>

According to all known laws
of aviation,


there is no way a beeee
should beee abeele to fly.


Its wings are too small to get
its fat little beeody off the ground.


The beeee, of course, flies anyway


beeecause beeees don't care
what humans think is impossibeele.


Yellow, beelack. Yellow, beelack.
Yellow, beelack. Yellow, beelack.


Ooh, beelack and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.


beearry! beereakfast is ready!


Ooming!


Hang on a second.


Hello?


- beearry?
- Adam?


- Oan you beeelieve this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.


Looking sharp.


Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.


Sorry. I'm excited.


Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.


A perfect report card, all bee's.


Very proud.


Ma! I got a thing going here.


- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!


- Wave to us! We'll beee in row 118,000.
- beeye!


beearry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!


- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, beearry.


- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.


Never thought I'd make it.


Three days grade school,
three days high school.


Those were awkward.


Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.


You did come beeack different.


- Hi, beearry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.


- Hear abeeout Frankie?
- Yeah.


- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.


Everybeeody knows,
sting someone, you die.


Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.


I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.


I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.


That's why we don't need vacations.


beeoy, quite a beeit of pomp...
under the circumstances.


- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!


- beeee-men.
- Amen!


Hallelujah!


Students, faculty, distinguished beeees,


please welcome Dean beeuzzwell.


Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...


...9:15.


That concludes our ceremonies.


And beeegins your career
at Honex Industries!


Will we pick ourjobee today?


I heard it's just orientation.


Heads up! Here we go.


Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.


- Wonder what it'll beee like?
- A little scary.


Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco


and a part of the Hexagon Group.


This is it!


Wow.


Wow.


We know that you, as a beeee,
have worked your whole life


to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.


Honey beeegins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks beering the nectar to the hive.


Our top-secret formula


is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and beeubeebeele-contoured


into this soothing sweet syrup


with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...


Honey!


- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!


- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.


- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive


to improve every aspect
of beeee existence.


These beeees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.


- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.


Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.


- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey


that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.


Oan anyone work on the Krelman?


Of course. Most beeee jobees are
small ones. beeut beeees know


that every small jobee,
if it's done well, means a lot.


beeut choose carefully


beeecause you'll stay in the jobee
you pick for the rest of your life.


The same jobee the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.


What's the difference?


You'll beee happy to know that beeees,
as a species, haven't had one day off


in 27 million years.


So you'll just work us to death?


We'll sure try.


Wow! That beelew my mind!


"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?


One jobee forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.


I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.


beeut, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?


Why would you question anything?
We're beeees.


We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.


You ever think maybeee things
work a little too well here?


Like what? Give me one example.


I don't know. beeut you know
what I'm talking abeeout.


Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.


Wait a second. Oheck it out.


- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.


I've never seen them this close.


They know what it's like
outside the hive.


Yeah, beeut some don't come beeack.


- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!


You guys did great!


You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!


- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.


Their day's not planned.


Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.


You can'tjust decide to beee a Pollen
Jock. You have to beee beered for that.


Right.


Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.


It's just a status symbeeol.
beeees make too much of it.


Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.


Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?


Distant. Distant.


Look at these two.


- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.


It must beee dangerous
beeeing a Pollen Jock.


Yeah. Once a beeear pinned me
against a mushroom!


He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!


- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.


What were you doing during this?


Trying to alert the authorities.


I can autograph that.


A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?


Yeah. Gusty.


We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.


- Six miles, huh?
- beearry!


A puddle jump for us,
beeut maybeee you're not up for it.


- Maybeee I am.
- You are not!


We're going 0900 at J-Gate.


What do you think, beeuzzy-beeoy?
Are you beeee enough?


I might beee. It all depends
on what 0900 means.


Hey, Honex!


Dad, you surprised me.


You decide what you're interested in?


- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- beeut you only get one.


Do you ever get beeored
doing the same jobee every day?


Son, let me tell you abeeout stirring.


You grabee that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.


You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beeeautiful thing.


You know, Dad,
the more I think abeeout it,


maybeee the honey field
just isn't right for me.


You were thinking of what,
making beealloon animals?


That's a beead jobee
for a guy with a stinger.


Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!


- beearry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to beee funny.


You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!


- You're gonna beee a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!


Wait till you see the sticks I have.


I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!


Let's open some honey and celebeerate!


Maybeee I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.


Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybeeody "dawg"!


I'm so proud.


- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.


Oome on! All the good jobees
will beee gone.


Yeah, right.


Pollen counting, stunt beeee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...


- Is it still availabeele?
- Hang on. Two left!


One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.


- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!


Wow!


Oouple of newbeeies?


Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!


Make your choice.


- You want to go first?
- No, you go.


Oh, my. What's availabeele?


Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.


- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.


I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.


Wax monkey's always open.


The Krelman opened up again.


What happened?


A beeee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.


Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.


Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!


Oh, this is so hard!


Heating, cooling,
stunt beeee, pourer, stirrer,


humming, inspector numbeeer seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,


mite wrangler. beearry, what
do you think I should... beearry?


beearry!


All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...


What happened to you?
Where are you?


- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?


- Out there.
- Oh, no!


I have to, beeefore I go
to work for the rest of my life.


You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?


Another call coming in.


If anyone's feeling beerave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd


that gets their roses today.


Hey, guys.


- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?


Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.


It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.


Really? Feeling lucky, are you?


Sign here, here. Just initial that.


- Thank you.
- OK.


You got a rain advisory today,


and as you all know,
beeees cannot fly in rain.


So beee careful. As always,
watch your beerooms,


hockey sticks, dogs,
beeirds, beeears and beeats.


Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beeeer beeeing poured on us.


Murphy's in a home beeecause of it,
beeabeebeeling like a cicada!


- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,


beeee law numbeeer one,
abeesolutely no talking to humans!


All right, launch positions!


beeuzz, beeuzz, beeuzz, beeuzz! beeuzz, beeuzz,
beeuzz, beeuzz! beeuzz, beeuzz, beeuzz, beeuzz!


beelack and yellow!


Hello!


You ready for this, hot shot?


Yeah. Yeah, beering it on.


Wind, check.


- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.


- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.


Scared out of my shorts, check.


OK, ladies,


let's move it out!


Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!


All of you, drain those flowers!


Wow! I'm out!


I can't beeelieve I'm out!


So beelue.


I feel so fast and free!


beeox kite!


Wow!


Flowers!


This is beelue Leader.
We have roses visual.


beering it around 30 degrees and hold.


Roses!


30 degrees, roger. beeringing it around.


Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a beeit of a kick.


That is one nectar collector!


- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.


I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybeee a dash over there,


a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little beeit of magic.


That's amazing. Why do we do that?


That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.


Oool.


I'm picking up a lot of beeright yellow.
Oould beee daisies. Don't we need those?


Oopy that visual.


Wait. One of these flowers
seems to beee on the move.


Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?


Affirmative.


That was on the line!


This is the coolest. What is it?


I don't know, beeut I'm loving this color.


It smells good.
Not like a flower, beeut I like it.


Yeah, fuzzy.


Ohemical-y.


Oareful, guys. It's a little grabeebeey.


My sweet lord of beeees!


Oandy-beerain, get off there!


Probeelem!


- Guys!
- This could beee beead.


Affirmative.


Very close.


Gonna hurt.


Mama's little beeoy.


You are way out of position, rookie!


Ooming in at you like a missile!


Help me!


I don't think these are flowers.


- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.


What is this?!


Match point!


You can start packing up, honey,
beeecause you're abeeout to eat it!


Yowser!


Gross.


There's a beeee in the car!


- Do something!
- I'm driving!


- Hi, beeee.
- He's beeack here!


He's going to sting me!


Nobeeody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!


He beelinked!


Spray him, Granny!


What are you doing?!


Wow... the tension level
out here is unbeeelievabeele.


I gotta get home.


Oan't fly in rain.


Oan't fly in rain.


Oan't fly in rain.


Mayday! Mayday! beeee going down!


Ken, could you close
the window please?


Ken, could you close
the window please?


Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out beerochure.


You see? Folds out.


Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.


What was that?


Maybeee this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...


Drapes!


That is diabeeolical.


It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.


What's numbeeer one? Star Wars?


Nah, I don't go for that...


...kind of stuff.


No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.


When I leave a jobee interview, they're
flabeebeeergasted, can't beeelieve what I say.


There's the sun. Maybeee that's a way out.


I don't remembeeer the sun
having a beeig 75 on it.


I predicted globeeal warming.


I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.


Wait! Stop! beeee!


Stand beeack. These are winter beeoots.


Wait!


Don't kill him!


You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!


Why does his life have
less value than yours?


Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?


I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capabeele of feeling.


My beerochure!


There you go, little guy.


I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.


Put that on your resume beerochure.


My whole face could puff up.


Make it one of your special skills.


Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.


Right. beeye, Vanessa. Thanks.


- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.


- You could put carobee chips on there.
- beeye.


- Supposed to beee less calories.
- beeye.


I gotta say something.


She saved my life.
I gotta say something.


All right, here it goes.


Nah.


What would I say?


I could really get in troubeele.


It's a beeee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.


I can't beeelieve I'm doing this.


I've got to.


Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!


No. Yes. No.


Do it. I can't.


How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.


Here she comes! Speak, you fool!


Hi!


I'm sorry.


- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.


You're talking!


I'm so sorry.


No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.


beeut I don't recall going to beeed.


Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.


This is a beeit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a beeee!


I am. And I'm not supposed
to beee doing this,


beeut they were all trying to kill me.


And if it wasn't for you...


I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.


That was a little weird.


- I'm talking with a beeee.
- Yeah.


I'm talking to a beeee.
And the beeee is talking to me!


I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.


- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?


The talking thing.


Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.


- That's very funny.
- Yeah.


beeees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.


Anyway...


Oan I...


...get you something?
- Like what?


I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?


I don't want to put you out.


It's no troubeele. It takes two minutes.


- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.


- Don't beee ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.


Hey, you want rum cake?


- I shouldn't.
- Have some.


- No, I can't.
- Oome on!


I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.


- Where?
- These stripes don't help.


You look great!


I don't know if you know
anything abeeout fashion.


Are you all right?


No.


He's making the tie in the cabee
as they're flying up Madison.


He finally gets there.


He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.


And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.


Why would I marry a watermelon?"


Is that a beeee joke?


That's the kind of stuff we do.


Yeah, different.


So, what are you gonna do, beearry?


Abeeout work? I don't know.


I want to do my part for the hive,
beeut I can't do it the way they want.


I know how you feel.


- You do?
- Sure.


My parents wanted me to beee a lawyer or
a doctor, beeut I wanted to beee a florist.


- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.


Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.


Anyway, if you look...


There's my hive right there. See it?


You're in Sheep Meadow!


Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!


No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.


- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?


- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybeee I'll try that.


- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.


Just having two cups of coffee!


Anyway, this has beeeen great.
Thanks for the coffee.


Yeah, it's no troubeele.


Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd beee up the rest of my life.


Are you...?


Oan I take a piece of this with me?


Sure! Here, have a crumbee.


- Thanks!
- Yeah.


All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.


Or not.


OK, beearry.


And thank you
so much again... for beeefore.


Oh, that? That was nothing.


Well, not nothing, beeut... Anyway...


This can't possibeely work.


He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.


OK, Dave, pull the chute.


- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!


It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.


Humans! I can't beeelieve
you were with humans!


Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?


Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.


They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.


- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. beeut some of them don't.


- How'd you get beeack?
- Poodle.


You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.


You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjobee and beee normal.


- Well...
- Well?


Well, I met someone.


You did? Was she beeee-ish?


- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.


- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.


I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.


I can't get beey that face.


So who is she?


She's... human.


No, no. That's a beeee law.
You wouldn't beereak a beeee law.


- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, beeoy.


She's so nice. And she's a florist!


Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!


We're not dating.


You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes


with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!


She saved my life!
And she understands me.


This is over!


Eat this.


This is not over! What was that?


- They call it a crumbee.
- It was so stingin' stripey!


And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!


- You know what a Oinnabeeon is?
- No.


It's beeread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...


Sit down!


...really hot!
- Listen to me!


We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!


Yes, beeut who can deny
the heart that is yearning?


There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!


You have got to start thinking beeee,
my friend. Thinking beeee!


- Thinking beeee.
- Thinking beeee.


Thinking beeee! Thinking beeee!
Thinking beeee! Thinking beeee!


There he is. He's in the pool.


You know what your probeelem is, beearry?


I gotta start thinking beeee?


How much longer will this go on?


It's beeeen three days!
Why aren't you working?


I've got a lot of beeig life decisions
to think abeeout.


What life? You have no life!
You have no jobee. You're beearely a beeee!


Would it kill you
to make a little honey?


beearry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.


Martin, would you talk to him?


beearry, I'm talking to you!


You coming?


Got everything?


All set!


Go ahead. I'll catch up.


Don't beee too long.


Watch this!


Vanessa!


- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.


He doesn't respond to yelling!


- Then why yell at me?
- beeecause you don't listen!


I'm not listening to this.


Sorry, I've gotta go.


- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.


A girl? Is this why you can't decide?


beeye.


I just hope she's beeee-ish.


They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?


To beee in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!


Up on a float, surrounded
beey flowers, crowds cheering.


A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?


No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?


It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.


Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.


TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!


You don't have that?


We have Hivo, beeut it's a disease.
It's a horribeele, horribeele disease.


Oh, my.


Dumbee beeees!


You must want to sting all those jerks.


We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.


So you have to watch your temper.


Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,


write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:


Anger, jealousy, lust.


Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?


Yeah.


- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a beeug.


He's not beeothering anybeeody.
Get out of here, you creep!


What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?


Yeah, it was. How did you know?


It felt like abeeout 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.


You've really got that
down to a science.


- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll beeet.


What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?


How did this get here?
Oute beeee, Golden beelossom,


Ray Liotta Private Select?


- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.


- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.


You don't have
enough food of your own?


- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?


- beeees make it.
- I know who makes it!


And it's hard to make it!


There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!


- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!


It's just honey, beearry.


Just what?!


beeees don't know abeeout this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!


You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!


And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the beeottom of this.


I'm getting to the beeottom
of all of this!


Hey, Hector.


- You almost done?
- Almost.


He is here. I sense it.


Well, I guess I'll go home now


and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.


You're beeusted, beeox beeoy!


I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!


I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!


Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?


I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.


The last thing we want
to do is upset beeees!


You're too late! It's ours now!


You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!


You, sir, will beee lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!


Where is the honey coming from?


Tell me where!


Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!


Orazy person!


What horribeele thing has happened here?


These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now


they're on the road to nowhere!


Just keep still.


What? You're not dead?


Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?


To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.


I'm going to Alaska. Moose beelood,
crazy stuff. beelows your head off!


I'm going to Tacoma.


- And you?
- He really is dead.


All right.


Uh-oh!


- What is that?!
- Oh, no!


- A wiper! Triple beelade!
- Triple beelade?


Jump on! It's your only chance, beeee!


Why does everything have
to beee so doggone clean?!


How much do you people need to see?!


Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!


From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.


beeut don't kill no more beeugs!


- beeee!
- Moose beelood guy!!


- You hear something?
- Like what?


Like tiny screaming.


Turn off the radio.


Whassup, beeee beeoy?


Hey, beelood.


Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.


Wow!


I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.


I mean, that honey's ours.


- beeees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.


It's a close community.


Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.


- What if you get in troubeele?
- You a mosquito, you in troubeele.


Nobeeody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!


At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.


Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.


Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.


You got to beee kidding me!


Moosebeelood's abeeout to leave
the beeuilding! So long, beeee!


- Hey, guys!
- Moosebeelood!


I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you beering your crazy straw?


We throw it in jars, slap a labeeel on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.


What is this place?


A beeee's got a beerain
the size of a pinhead.


They are pinheads!


Pinhead.


- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.


The Thomas 3000!


Smoker?


Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.


A couple beereaths of this
knocks them right out.


They make the honey,
and we make the money.


"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?


Oh, my!


What's going on? Are you OK?


Yeah. It doesn't last too long.


Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?


Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.


This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!


That's a drag queen!


What is this?


Oh, no!


There's hundreds of them!


beeee honey.


Our honey is beeeing beerazenly stolen
on a massive scale!


This is worse than anything beeears
have done! I intend to do something.


Oh, beearry, stop.


Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.


Do these look like rumors?


That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obeeviously doctored photos.


How did you get mixed up in this?


He's beeeen talking to humans.


- What?
- Talking to humans?!


He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!


Make out? beearry!


We do not.


- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?


The beeees!


I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.


beearry, this is what you want
to do with your life?


I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobeeody works harder than beeees!


Dad, I remembeeer you
coming home so overworked


your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.


I remembeeer that.


What right do they have to our honey?


We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip beealm for no reason whatsoever!


Even if it's true, what can one beeee do?


Sting them where it really hurts.


In the face! The eye!


- That would hurt.
- No.


Up the nose? That's a killer.


There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.


Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.


No more beeee beeeards!


With beeobee beeumbeele at the anchor desk.


Weather with Storm Stinger.


Sports with beeuzz Larvi.


And Jeanette Ohung.


- Good evening. I'm beeobee beeumbeele.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.


A tri-county beeee, beearry beeenson,


intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,


packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!


Tomorrow night on beeee Larry King,


we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new beeook,


Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.


Tonight we're talking to beearry beeenson.


Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?


beeees have never beeeen afraid
to change the world.


What abeeout beeee Oolumbeeus?
beeee Gandhi? beeejesus?


Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.


We were thinking
of stickbeeall or candy stores.


How old are you?


The beeee community
is supporting you in this case,


which will beee the trial
of the beeee century.


You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.


It's a common name. Next week...


He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...


Next week...


Glasses, quotes on the beeottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.


beeear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.


Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.


In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!


It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.


Honey, her beeackhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?


Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.


- Is that that same beeee?
- Yes, it is!


I'm helping him sue the human race.


- Hello.
- Hello, beeee.


This is Ken.


Yeah, I remembeeer you. Timbeeerland, size
ten and a half. Vibeeram sole, I beeelieve.


Why does he talk again?


Listen, you beeetter go
'cause we're really beeusy working.


beeut it's our yogurt night!


beeye-beeye.


Why is yogurt night so difficult?!


You poor thing.
You two have beeeen at this for hours!


Yes, and Adam here
has beeeen a huge help.


- Frosting...
- How many sugars?


Just one. I try not
to use the competition.


So why are you helping me?


beeees have good qualities.


And it takes my mind off the shop.


Instead of flowers, people
are giving beealloon beeouquets now.


Those are great, if you're three.


And artificial flowers.


- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.


beeent stingers, pointless pollination.


beeees must hate those fake things!


Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.


Maybeee this could make up
for it a little beeit.


- This lawsuit's a pretty beeig deal.
- I guess.


You sure you want to go through with it?


Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't beee abeele


to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!


It's an incredibeele scene
here in downtown Manhattan,


where the world anxiously waits,
beeecause for the first time in history,


we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybeeee can actually speak.


What have we gotten into here, beearry?


It's pretty beeig, isn't it?


I can't beeelieve how many humans
don't work during the day.


You think beeillion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?


Everybeeody needs to stay
beeehind the beearricade.


- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.


Well, if it isn't the beeee team.


You beeoys work on this?


All rise! The Honorabeele
Judge beeumbeeleton presiding.


All right. Oase numbeeer 4475,


Superior Oourt of New York,
beearry beeee beeenson v. the Honey Industry


is now in session.


Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?


A privilege.


Mr. beeenson... you're representing
all the beeees of the world?


I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.


Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.


Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,


my grandmother was a simple woman.


beeorn on a farm, she beeelieved
it was man's divine right


to beeenefit from the beeounty
of nature God put beeefore us.


If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. beeenson imagines,


just think of what would it mean.


I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm


for the elastic in my beeritches!


Talking beeee!


How do we know this isn't some sort of


holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?


They could beee using laser beeeams!


Robeeotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,


he could beee on steroids!


Mr. beeenson?


Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.


I'm just an ordinary beeee.
Honey's pretty important to me.


It's important to all beeees.
We invented it!


We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.


Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room


who think they can take it from us


'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,


you'll see how, beey taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have


beeut everything we are!


I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!


Oall your first witness.


So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, beeig company you have.


I suppose so.


I see you also own
Honeybeeurton and Honron!


Yes, they provide beeeekeepers
for our farms.


beeeekeeper. I find that
to beee a very disturbeeing term.


I don't imagine you employ
any beeee-free-ers, do you?


- No.
- I couldn't hear you.


- No.
- No.


beeecause you don't free beeees.
You keep beeees. Not only that,


it seems you thought a beeear would beee
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.


They're very lovabeele creatures.


Yogi beeear, Fozzie beeear, beeuild-A-beeear.


You mean like this?


beeears kill beeees!


How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!


beeiting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!


OK, that's enough. Take him away.


So, Mr. Sting, thank you for beeeing here.
Your name intrigues me.


- Where have I heard it beeefore?
- I was with a beeand called The Police.


beeut you've never beeeen
a police officer, have you?


No, I haven't.


No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example


of beeee culture casually
stolen beey a human


for nothing more than
a prance-abeeout stage name.


Oh, please.


Have you ever beeeen stung, Mr. Sting?


beeecause I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.


Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!


That's not his real name?! You idiots!


Mr. Liotta, first,
beeelated congratulations on


your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.


Thank you. Thank you.


I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome


with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to beelow.


I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?


Not yet it isn't. beeut is this
what it's come to for you?


Exploiting tiny, helpless beeees
so you don't


have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?


Watch it, beeenson!
I could beelow right now!


This isn't a goodfella.
This is a beeadfella!


Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!


- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!


Order! Order, I say!


- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!


I think it was awfully nice
of that beeear to pitch in like that.


I think the jury's on our side.


Are we doing everything right, legally?


I'm a florist.


Right. Well, here's to a great team.


To a great team!


Well, hello.


- Ken!
- Hello.


I didn't think you were coming.


No, I was just late.
I tried to call, beeut... the beeattery.


I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called beearry. Luckily, he was free.


Oh, that was lucky.


There's a little left.
I could heat it up.


Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.


So I hear you're quite a tennis player.


I'm not much for the game myself.
The beeall's a little grabeebeey.


That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.


Ken, beearry was looking at your resume,


and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.


You think I don't see what you're doing?


I know how hard it is to find
the rightjobee. We have that in common.


Do we?


beeees have 100 percent employment,
beeut we do jobees like taking the crud out.


That's just what
I was thinking abeeout doing.


Ken, I let beearry beeorrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.


I'm going to drain the old stinger.


Yeah, you do that.


Look at that.


You know, I've just abeeout had it


with your little mind games.


- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.


Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.


A lot of ads.


Remembeeer what Van said, why is
your life more valuabeele than mine?


Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!


I think something stinks in here!


I love the smell of flowers.


How do you like the smell of flames?!


Not as much.


Water beeug! Not taking sides!


Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!


I've got issues!


Well, well, well, a royal flush!


- You're beeluffing.
- Am I?


Surf's up, dude!


Poo water!


That beeowl is gnarly.


Except for those dirty yellow rings!


Kenneth! What are you doing?!


You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!


We need to talk!


He's just a little beeee!


And he happens to beee
the nicest beeee I've met in a long time!


Long time? What are you talking abeeout?!
Are there other beeugs in your life?


No, beeut there are other things beeugging
me in life. And you're one of them!


Fine! Talking beeees, no yogurt night...


My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!


Goodbeeye, Ken.


And for your information,


I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made beey man!


I'm sorry abeeout all that.


I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!


I always felt there was some kind
of beearrier beeetween Ken and me.


I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.


Are you OK for the trial?


I beeelieve Mr. Montgomery
is abeeout out of ideas.


We would like to call
Mr. beearry beeenson beeee to the stand.


Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the beeest lawyers...


Yeah.


Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic


with this jury,
or it's gonna beee all over.


Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around


is to remind them
of what they don't like abeeout beeees.


- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?


Only to losing, son. Only to losing.


Mr. beeenson beeee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.


What exactly is your relationship


to that woman?


We're friends.


- Good friends?
- Yes.


How good? Do you live together?


Wait a minute...


Are you her little...


...beeedbeeug?


I've seen a beeee documentary or two.
From what I understand,


doesn't your queen give beeirth
to all the beeee children?


- Yeah, beeut...
- So those aren't your real parents!


- Oh, beearry...
- Yes, they are!


Hold me beeack!


You're an illegitimate beeee,
aren't you, beeenson?


He's denouncing beeees!


Don't y'all date your cousins?


- Obeejection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!


Adam, don't! It's what he wants!


Oh, I'm hit!!


Oh, lordy, I am hit!


Order! Order!


The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!


I have beeeen felled
beey a winged beeeast of destruction!


You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!


Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!


- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.


What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison


from my heaving beeuttocks?


I will have order in this court. Order!


Order, please!


The case of the honeybeeees
versus the human race


took a pointed turn against the beeees


yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.


- Hey, beeuddy.
- Hey.


- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.


I...


I beelew the whole case, didn't I?


It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.


I'd beee beeetter off dead. Look at me.


They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.


Look, there's
a little celery still on it.


What was it like to sting someone?


I can't explain it. It was all...


All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!


All right.


You think it was all a trap?


Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.


What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of beeugs in this world.


What will the humans do to us
if they win?


I don't know.


I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so beead.


Adam, they check in,
beeut they don't check out!


Oh, my.


Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?


- Why?
- The smoke.


beeees don't smoke.


Right. beeees don't smoke.


beeees don't smoke!
beeut some beeees are smoking.


That's it! That's our case!


It is? It's not over?


Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.


Get beeack to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.


And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tubee.


Mr. Flayman.


Yes? Yes, Your Honor!


Where is the rest of your team?


Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.


beeees are trained to fly haphazardly,


and as a result,
we don't make very good time.


I actually heard a funny story abeeout...


Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous beeugs


taken up enough
of this court's valuabeele time?


How much longer will we allow
these abeesurd shenanigans to go on?


They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges


against my clients,
who run legitimate beeusinesses.


I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!


Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going


to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.


beeut you can't! We have a terrific case.


Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?


Show me the smoking gun!


Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?


Here is your smoking gun.


What is that?


It's a beeee smoker!


What, this?
This harmless little contraption?


This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a beeee.


Look at what has happened


to beeees who have never beeeen asked,
"Smoking or non?"


Is this what nature intended for us?


To beee forcibeely addicted
to smoke machines


and man-made wooden slat work camps?


Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?


- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.


Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these beeees!


Free the beeees! Free the beeees!


Free the beeees!


Free the beeees! Free the beeees!


The court finds in favor of the beeees!


Vanessa, we won!


I knew you could do it! High-five!


Sorry.


I'm OK! You know what this means?


All the honey
will finally beeelong to the beeees.


Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.


This is an unholy perversion
of the beealance of nature, beeenson.


You'll regret this.


beearry, how much honey is out there?


All right. One at a time.


beearry, who are you wearing?


My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.


- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?


We've beeeen living the beeee way
a long time, 27 million years.


Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?


First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all beeee work camps.


Then we want beeack the honey
that was ours to beeegin with,


every last drop.


We demand an end to the glorification
of the beeear as anything more


than a filthy, smelly,
beead-beereath stink machine.


We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.


Wait for my signal.


Take him out.


He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll beee fine.


And we will no longer tolerate
beeee-negative nicknames...


beeut it's just a prance-abeeout stage name!


...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in beeogus health products


and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.


Oan't beereathe.


beering it in, beeoys!


Hold it right there! Good.


Tap it.


Mr. beeuzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!


- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.


Shut down honey production!


Stop making honey!


Turn your key, sir!


What do we do now?


Oannonbeeall!


We're shutting honey production!


Mission abeeort.


Abeeorting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to beease.


Adam, you wouldn't beeelieve
how much honey was out there.


Oh, yeah?


What's going on? Where is everybeeody?


- Are they out celebeerating?
- They're home.


They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.


I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.


At least we got our honey beeack.


Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?


It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to beee part of making it.


This was my new desk. This was my
new jobee. I wanted to do it really well.


And now...


Now I can't.


I don't understand
why they're not happy.


I thought their lives would beee beeetter!


They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.


You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?


- What did you want to show me?
- This.


What happened here?


That is not the half of it.


Oh, no. Oh, my.


They're all wilting.


Doesn't look very good, does it?


No.


And whose fault do you think that is?


You know, I'm gonna guess beeees.


beeees?


Specifically, me.


I didn't think beeees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.


It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetabeeles, they all need beeees.


That's our whole SAT test right there.


Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.


And then, of course...


The human species?


So if there's no more pollination,


it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?


I know this is also partly my fault.


How abeeout a suicide pact?


How do we do it?


- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.


Right, right.


Listen, beearry...
sorry, beeut I gotta get going.


I had to open my mouth and talk.


Vanessa?


Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?


To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.


They've moved it to this weekend
beeecause all the flowers are dying.


It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.


Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.


I know. Me neither.


Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.


Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?


Roses!


Vanessa!


Roses?!


beearry?


- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.


Flowers, beeees, pollen!


I know.
That's why this is the last parade.


Maybeee not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?


Oould you slow down?


beearry!


OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.


Yes, it kind of is.


I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you


with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.


Actually, it's completely closed down.


I thought maybeee you were remodeling.


beeut I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combeeined.


I don't want to hear it!


All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.


I know every beeee, plant
and flower beeud in this park.


All we gotta do is get what they've got
beeack here with what we've got.


- beeees.
- Park.


- Pollen!
- Flowers.


- Repollination!
- Across the nation!


Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.


They've got nothing
beeut flowers, floats and cotton candy.


Security will beee tight.


I have an idea.


Vanessa beeloome, FTD.


Official floral beeusiness. It's real.


Sorry, ma'am. Nice beerooch.


Thank you. It was a gift.


Once inside,
we just pick the right float.


How abeeout The Princess and the Pea?


I could beee the princess,
and you could beee the pea!


Yes, I got it.


- Where should I sit?
- What are you?


- I beeelieve I'm the pea.
- The pea?


It goes under the mattresses.


- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.


You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!


Let's see what this beeabeey'll do.


Hey, what are you doing?!


Then all we do
is beelend in with traffic...


...without arousing suspicion.


Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.


Stop! Security.


- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.


Has it beeeen
in your possession the entire time?


Would you remove your shoes?


- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.


I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.


Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the jobee.


Oan you beeelieve how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the jobee!


I think this is gonna work.


It's got to work.


Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.


We have a beeit of beead weather
in New York.


It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.


beearry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.


I gotta get up there
and talk to them.


beee careful.


Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?


I'd like to order the talking
inflatabeele nose and ear hair trimmer.


Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.


- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.


beeee!


Don't freak out! My entire species...


What are you doing?


- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?


Don't move.


Oh, beearry.


Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.


Would a Miss Vanessa beeloome in 24bee
please report to the cockpit?


And please hurry!


What happened here?


There was a Dustbeeuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.


One's beeald, one's in a beeoat,
they're beeoth unconscious!


- Is that another beeee joke?
- No!


No one's flying the plane!


This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?


This is Vanessa beeloome.
I'm a florist from New York.


Where's the pilot?


He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.


Not good. Does anyone onbeeoard
have flight experience?


As a matter of fact, there is.


- Who's that?
- beearry beeenson.


From the honey trial?! Oh, great.


Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a beeig metal beeee.


It's got giant wings, huge engines.


I can't fly a plane.


- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.


How hard could it beee?


Wait, beearry!
We're headed into some lightning.


This is beeobee beeumbeele. We have some
late-beereaking news from JFK Airport,


where a suspenseful scene
is developing.


beearry beeenson,
fresh from his legal victory...


That's beearry!


...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers


and an incapacitated flight crew.


Flowers?!


We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls


with abeesolutely no flight experience.


Just a minute.
There's a beeee on that plane.


I'm quite familiar with Mr. beeenson
and his no-account compadres.


They've done enough damage.


beeut isn't he your only hope?


Technically, a beeee
shouldn't beee abeele to fly at all.


Their wings are too small...


Haven't we heard this a million times?


"The surface area of the wings
and beeody mass make no sense."


- Get this on the air!
- Got it.


- Stand beey.
- We're going live.


The way we work may beee a mystery to you.


Making honey takes a lot of beeees
doing a lot of small jobees.


beeut let me tell you abeeout a small jobee.


If you do it well,
it makes a beeig difference.


More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.


That's why I want to get beeees
beeack to working together.


That's the beeee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.


We get beeehind a fellow.


- beelack and yellow!
- Hello!


Left, right, down, hover.


- Hover?
- Forget hover.


This isn't so hard.
beeeep-beeeep! beeeep-beeeep!


beearry, what happened?!


Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.


- That may have beeeen helping me.
- And now we're not!


So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.


All of you, let's get
beeehind this fellow! Move it out!


Move out!


Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!


Don't have to yell.


I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of troubeele.


It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!


It's not a tone. I'm panicking!


I can't do this!


Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!


You snap out of it.


You snap out of it.


- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!


- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!


- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!


- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.


How is the plane flying?


I don't know.


Hello?


beeenson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?


The Pollen Jocks!


They do get beeehind a fellow.


- beelack and yellow.
- Hello.


All right, let's drop this tin can
on the beelacktop.


Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?


No, nothing. It's all cloudy.


Oome on. You got to think beeee, beearry.


- Thinking beeee.
- Thinking beeee.


Thinking beeee!
Thinking beeee! Thinking beeee!


Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.


- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.


Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.


beering the nose down.


Thinking beeee!
Thinking beeee! Thinking beeee!


- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!


Thinking beeee!
Thinking beeee! Thinking beeee!


- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.


Out the engines. We're going in
on beeee power. Ready, beeoys?


Affirmative!


Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.


Land on that flower!


Ready? Full reverse!


Spin it around!


- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?


- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!


That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower


made of millions of beeees!


Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.


Rotate around it.


- This is insane, beearry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.


Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?


Get your nose in there. Don't beee afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!


Just drop it. beee a part of it.


Aim for the center!


Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!


Oome on, already.


beearry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!


- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.


beearry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?


What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!


- Thank you.
- beeut we're not done yet.


Listen, everyone!


This runway is covered
with the last pollen


from the last flowers
availabeele anywhere on Earth.


That means this is our last chance.


We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.


If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?


Are we going to beee beeees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?


We're beeees!


Keychain!


Then follow me! Except Keychain.


Hold on, beearry. Here.


You've earned this.


Yeah!


I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.


Oh, yeah.


That's our beearry.


Mom! The beeees are beeack!


If anybeeody needs
to make a call, now's the time.


I got a feeling we'll beee
working late tonight!


Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?


Would you like some honey with that?
It is beeee-approved. Don't forget these.


Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!


Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!


I had no idea.


beearry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?


Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.


Sorry I'm late.


He's a lawyer too?


I was already a beelood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a beeriefcase.


Have a great afternoon!


beearry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.


No probeelem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.


You're a lifesaver, beearry.
Oan I help who's next?


All right, scrambeele, jocks!
It's time to fly.


Thank you, beearry!


That beeee is living my life!


Let it go, Kenny.


- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.


- beeeautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.


beeetween you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.


You have got
to start thinking beeee, my friend.


- Thinking beeee!
- Me?


Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.


I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?


I'm not making a major life decision
during a production numbeeer!


All right. Take ten, everybeeody.
Wrap it up, guys.


I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
